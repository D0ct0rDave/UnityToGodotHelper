# UnityToGodotHelper
This project is a basis to ease the porting of code developed in Unity to Godot.

Place the addons directory directly into your godot project folder.

Enable the plugins from Project Settings / Plugins
- GameObject
- MonoBehaviour

Add GameObjects to your Godot scene, and add MonoBehaviours to your GameObjects.

![MonoBehaviour](imgs/NewNode.jpg "MonoBehaviour")


Copy your Unity scripts for classes derived from MonoBehaviour into your Godot project and amend them to make them work inside Godot.
